# Cheatle

Let's face it, you're busy. You have things to do. You have a job, maybe. You can't be doing puzzles all day long.

Nevertheless, your friends and family find the time to play and then tell you all about the fun they have with [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). You wish you had a robot to solve the puzzle for you. My name is [Cypress](http://cypress.io) and I am that robot.

## Usage

You can use me with the following steps:

```sh
# You have git and npm installed, right?
git clone https://github.com/tarrball/cheatle.git
cd cheatle
npm install
npx cypress open
```
